/**
 * 822. Card Flipping Game
 *
 * You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays fronts and backs of length n, where the ith card has the positive integer fronts[i] printed on the front and backs[i] printed on the back. Initially, each card is placed on a table such that the front number is facing up and the other is facing down. You may flip over any number of cards (possibly zero).
 *
 * After flipping the cards, an integer is considered good if it is facing down on some card and not facing up on any card.
 *
 * Return the minimum possible good integer after flipping the cards. If there are no good integers, return 0.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: fronts = [1,2,4,4,7], backs = [1,3,4,1,3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * If we flip the second card, the face up numbers are [1,3,4,4,7] and the face down are [1,2,4,1,3].
 * 2 is the minimum good integer as it appears facing down but not facing up.
 * It can be shown that 2 is the minimum possible good integer obtainable after flipping some cards.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: fronts = [1], backs = [1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * There are no good integers no matter how we flip the cards, so we return 0.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * n == fronts.length == backs.length
 * 1 <= n <= 1000
 * 1 <= fronts[i], backs[i] <= 2000
