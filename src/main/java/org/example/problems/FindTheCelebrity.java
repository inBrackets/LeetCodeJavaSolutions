/**

 *
 * <p>Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may
 * exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know
 * him/her but he/she does not know any of them.
 *
 * <p>Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing
 * you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of
 * whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as
 * few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).
 *
 * <p>You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A knows B. Implement
 * a function int findCelebrity(n), your function should minimize the number of calls to knows.
 *
 * <p>Note: There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's
 * label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.
